Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables,
but the methods declared in an interface are 
by default abstract (only method signature, no body).  

    - Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
    - An Interface is about capabilities like a Player may be an interface and any class 
      implementing Player must be able to (or must implement) move().
      So it specifies a set of methods that the class has to implement.
    - If a class implements an interface and does not provide method bodies for all functions
      specified in the interface, then the class must be declared abstract.
